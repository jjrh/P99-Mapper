Project 1999 log based tools.

| What is it? |
+-------------+
Project 1999 is a everquest emulator server that tries to emulate the glory days
of Everquest like it was in 1999. Because of this, the server has disabled maps
and external tools that modify the client (such as macroquest) 

To get around this issue one can parse the logs everquest produces to do things
like provide a DPS meter, a semi accurate position on a map (using /loc) and
possibily other things. 

Because we process the log files everquest produces this is a perfectly 
acceptable method of providing a dps meter, a map, etc. ( I confirmed this
with people on the project 1999 irc channel. )
